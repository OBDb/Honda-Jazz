generations:
  - name: "First Generation"
    start_year: 2001
    end_year: 2008
    description: "The original Honda Jazz (sold as the Fit in some markets, including Japan and North America) revolutionized the subcompact category with its innovative 'Magic Seat' system and central fuel tank layout that maximized interior space. Featuring a tall, MPV-like profile, it offered exceptional interior flexibility with rear seats that could fold flat into the floor or have their seat cushions folded up to accommodate tall items. Powered by small-displacement four-cylinder engines ranging from 1.2L to 1.5L depending on the market, paired with either manual or automatic transmissions, it emphasized efficiency and practicality. The interior offered surprising spaciousness for the vehicle's external dimensions, with clever storage solutions throughout. This generation established the Jazz's reputation for exceptional space utilization and versatility, winning numerous awards globally including Japan Car of the Year."

  - name: "Second Generation"
    start_year: 2007
    end_year: 2014
    description: "The second-generation Jazz refined the successful formula with more aerodynamic styling, slightly larger dimensions, and enhanced refinement. The 'Magic Seat' system was improved with even more configurations, maintaining the model's class-leading versatility. Engine options continued with various small-displacement four-cylinders, typically ranging from 1.2L to 1.5L depending on the market, with improved fuel efficiency and slightly better performance. The interior featured higher quality materials and more technology features, including available navigation systems on higher trims. Safety was enhanced with standard stability control in many markets and improved crash structures. This generation further established the Jazz as a benchmark in the subcompact segment, combining exceptional practicality with a surprisingly enjoyable driving experience and Honda's reputation for reliability."

  - name: "Third Generation"
    start_year: 2013
    end_year: 2020
    description: "The third-generation Jazz featured more angular styling with a strong character line and a more prominent front end. While maintaining similar exterior dimensions to its predecessor, interior space improved further with class-leading rear legroom. The 'Magic Seat' system continued as a key feature, with refinements for even easier operation. Engine options varied by market but typically centered around efficient 1.3L to 1.5L four-cylinders, with hybrid variants available in some regions using Honda's i-DCD system that combined a 1.5L engine with an electric motor. The interior saw significant improvements in materials, design, and technology, featuring a touchscreen infotainment system on higher trims with smartphone connectivity. Safety technology advanced with the availability of Honda Sensing driver assistance features on later models. This generation maintained the Jazz's position as a space-efficient, versatile subcompact while adding more refinement and technology to appeal to increasingly sophisticated consumers."

  - name: "Fourth Generation"
    start_year: 2020
    end_year: null
    description: "The current Jazz features a more rounded, friendly design compared to its predecessor, with a focus on visibility and ease of use. The 'Magic Seat' system continues as a core feature, maintaining the model's exceptional versatility. Powertrain options have evolved significantly, with many markets (particularly Europe) focusing exclusively on hybrid powertrains using Honda's e:HEV system, which combines a 1.5L Atkinson-cycle engine with two electric motors for impressive efficiency. The interior has been completely redesigned with a more minimalist approach, featuring a digital instrument cluster, simplified control layout, and improved materials. Visibility has been enhanced with thinner A-pillars and a panoramic windshield design. Technology has advanced significantly with the latest Honda infotainment system and comprehensive Honda Sensing safety features standard on most variants. A crossover-inspired 'Crosstar' variant was introduced with slightly raised ride height, roof rails, and water-resistant upholstery. While this generation maintains the practical, space-efficient character that has defined the Jazz, it also reflects Honda's shift toward electrification as part of its environmental strategy. Note that with this generation, Honda discontinued the Jazz/Fit in North America, focusing instead on the HR-V crossover in that market."
